## The best-in-class Web and Mobile Food Ordering Technology ##

openrest is a modern system for online food ordering, enabling hungry customers to browse restaurant menus and make delivery or take-out orders. openrest integrates with existing restaurant web-sites and with Facebook, and offers an open API for developers.

The openrest API is exposed as a standard web service communicating JSON over HTTPS (see [cURL examples](openrest4curl.md)). For your convenience, we offer standard libraries for [Java](openrest4j.md), [.NET](openrest4net.md), Objective C, [JavaScript](openrest4js.md), COM objects, and more.

**Important note**: This web-site is aimed at developers who wish to connect to the openrest API. For business inquiries, please visit [the openrest web-site](http://www.openrest.com/) or contact your local openrest distributor (links available in individual restaurant web-sites).
